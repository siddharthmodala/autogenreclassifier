Movie Genre Classification Textual Analysis of Plot
==============
In this project I attempt to build an automatic movie genre classifier based on textual analysis of the plot of a movie. Currently, tagging of movies into genres is done manually and requires the person to watch the entire movie which is a time taking process. Internet movie database (IMDB) uses user reviews from trusted sources to tag each movie to its genre; this is a time taking process. Using AI techniques such as one v/s all Naive Bayesian and KNN we wish to automate this task and help speed up the process.  We are currently classifying [Adventure, Horror, Thriller, Crime and Documentary] and sub-genres [War and Sci-Fi]. In our approach we are trying to build a feature set consisting of the most frequently occurring words across all genres and use them as parameters whose values will help us model our classifier.  The Bayesian classifier that we built helped us identify the main genre and sub-genre but failed in multi label classification. Multi label classification was done with KNN classifier and  the results were satisfactory. We found that the feature set was not able to clearly distinguish the genres and we needed some more information to neatly segregate and group the genres. Use of more mature feature set and more robust classification methods would likely improve the results.
